## Summary
This tool provides the following features, usually not supported by standard simulation methods:
- GUI
- concurrent input / output (up to 330Hz)
- interactive experience with emulated HW

Although no "real-time" is supported, with simulation rates of up to 330Hz the stimulus and results are fast enough
to produce a realistic HW behavior.

For a project with improved performance, with up to 40kHz simulation rates, please refer to
