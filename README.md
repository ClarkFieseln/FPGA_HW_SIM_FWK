## Summary
This tool provides the following features, usually not supported by standard simulation methods:
- GUI
- concurrent input / output
- interactive experience with emulated HW
  (although no "real-time" is yet supported, with simulation rates of 250Hz the stimulus and results are fast enough
   to produce a realistic HW behavior. Soon this tool will be improved to work even much faster, up to 25kHz!)
